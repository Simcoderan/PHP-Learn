| `if-statement.php`             | Basic `if` condition — code runs if the condition is true.            |
| `if-else-statement.php`        | `if-else` condition — executes one block if true, another if false.   |
| `if-elseif-else-statement.php` | Chain of conditions using `elseif` for multiple checks.               |
| `switch-case.php`              | Uses `switch` to choose one block among many based on variable value. |
| `nested-if-statement.php`      | Demonstrates `if` inside another `if` — used for multi-level logic.   |
